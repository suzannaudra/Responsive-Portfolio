        <h1>Additional Resources</h1>
        May 17, 2020
        <p>While there are many sites available on the internet, to explain coding and learn different techniques. I wanted to put together a list of the sites that I've found to be the most useful.  For resources to supplement a class <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">codeacademy</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udmey</a> are both very useful. They offer step by step learning and walk you through any languange you are interested in learning at your own pace. Codeacacdemy uses activites along with their explantations so you can see and experience the coding process in real time.  Udemey utilizes the knowledgable teachers in the industry who walk you through step by step using a video tutorial giving you the code files so that you are able to follow along.  These are great sites to compliment your coding knowledge.  Another website that has been useful in explaning and implementing different coding languages is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a>.  This site has a lot of languages and interactive examples so you can see the code at work. This is a great resource if you need to look up a specific way of how to do something or implement a specific line of code to perform a specific function. Each of these sites offer a valuable knowledge and allow for continuous learning at your own pace. Learning coding is a continuous process. Memorizing every CSS style trick and every javascript command is difficult and resources like these exsist so that you don't have to. </p>
